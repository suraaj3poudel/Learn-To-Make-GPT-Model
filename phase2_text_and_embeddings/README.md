# Phase 2: Text and Embeddings - COMPLETE ✅

Master NLP fundamentals and word embeddings!

## 📚 Notebooks

### 01 - Text Processing and Embeddings
**Topics covered:**
- Tokenization strategies (word, subword, character)
- Building vocabulary from text
- One-hot encoding vs dense embeddings
- Word2Vec from scratch (Skip-gram implementation)
- Semantic similarity with cosine similarity
- Word analogies (king - man + woman = queen)
- Using pre-trained embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)

**What you'll build:** Your own Word2Vec model that learns meaningful word relationships!

### 02 - Sentiment Analysis
**Topics covered:**
- Text classification task
- Using embeddings for classification
- Building a neural network classifier
- Training with backpropagation
- Evaluating accuracy
- Testing on custom reviews

**What you'll build:** A sentiment analyzer that classifies text as positive or negative!

### 03 - Attention Mechanism
**Topics covered:**
- Why attention is needed (beyond averaging)
- Self-attention explained step-by-step
- Scaled dot-product attention
- Query, Key, Value matrices
- Multi-head attention preview
- Visualizing attention weights

**What you'll build:** Attention mechanism from scratch - the foundation of GPT!
