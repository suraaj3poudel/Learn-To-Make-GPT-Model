# 🚀 Using This Project with Google Colab

Google Colab is a free cloud-based Jupyter notebook service. No installation needed!

## ✨ **Benefits of Using Colab:**

- ✅ **Free** - No cost
- ✅ **Cloud-based** - Access from anywhere
- ✅ **Pre-installed libraries** - NumPy, Matplotlib, etc. already there
- ✅ **Free GPU access** - Useful for Phase 3-4 (transformers & GPT)
- ✅ **Auto-saves** to Google Drive
- ✅ **Share easily** with others
