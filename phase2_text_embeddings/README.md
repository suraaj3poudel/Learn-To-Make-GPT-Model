# Phase 2: Text and Embeddings

Welcome to Phase 2! Now you'll learn how AI understands text.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

1. **Text Processing** - How to prepare text for neural networks
2. **Word Embeddings** - Representing words as numbers
3. **Sentiment Analysis** - Build a model that understands emotions

## 📚 Notebooks (Coming in Phase 2)

### 1. `01_text_basics.ipynb`
- Tokenization and text preprocessing
- Building vocabulary
- One-hot encoding vs embeddings

### 2. `02_embeddings.ipynb`
- What are word embeddings?
- Word2Vec concepts
- Visualizing word relationships

### 3. `03_sentiment.ipynb`
- Build a sentiment analyzer
- Train on movie reviews
- Test on real data

## 🎓 Prerequisites

Complete Phase 1 first! You need to understand:
- ✅ Neural networks basics
- ✅ How training works
- ✅ Forward/backward propagation
