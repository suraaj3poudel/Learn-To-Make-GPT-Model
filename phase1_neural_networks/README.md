# Phase 1: Neural Networks Basics

Welcome to Phase 1! This is where your ML journey begins.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

1. **What are Neural Networks?** - Understanding the basics
2. **Building from Scratch** - Code a simple neural network without libraries
3. **MNIST Classifier** - Build a real image recognition system

## 📚 Notebooks (Complete in Order)

### 1. `01_introduction.ipynb` ⭐ START HERE
- What is machine learning?
- How do neural networks work?
- Visual introduction to neurons and layers
- Your first tiny neural network

**Time:** 30-45 minutes

---

### 2. `02_building_nn.ipynb`
- Build a neural network from scratch (just NumPy!)
- Understand forward propagation
- Understand backpropagation
- Train on simple XOR problem

**Time:** 1-2 hours

---

### 3. `03_mnist_classifier.ipynb`
- Introduction to PyTorch
- Build a real digit classifier
- Train on 60,000 images
- Test your model interactively
- **Goal: 95%+ accuracy!**

**Time:** 1-2 hours

---

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

By the end of Phase 1, you will:
- ✅ Understand how neural networks learn
- ✅ Know what forward/backward propagation means
- ✅ Have built a model from scratch
- ✅ Have a working image classifier
- ✅ Be ready for text and NLP!

## 💡 Tips

- Don't rush - understanding is more important than speed
- Run every code cell and observe the outputs
- Play with the visualizations
- Complete the exercises
- If stuck, re-read the explanations slowly
