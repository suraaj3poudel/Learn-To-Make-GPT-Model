# Phase 3: Mini Transformer

Welcome to Phase 3! This is where it gets really exciting - you'll build the architecture that powers GPT!

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

1. **Attention Mechanism** - The revolutionary concept behind modern AI
2. **Transformer Architecture** - Build it from scratch
3. **Training Transformers** - Make it learn patterns

## 📚 Notebooks (Coming in Phase 3)

### 1. `01_attention.ipynb`
- Self-attention mechanism
- Multi-head attention
- Why attention changed everything

### 2. `02_transformer.ipynb`
- Build a mini transformer
- Positional encodings
- Layer normalization

### 3. `03_training.ipynb`
- Train your transformer
- Text classification task
- Visualize attention patterns

## 🎓 Prerequisites

Complete Phases 1 and 2 first! You need to understand:
- ✅ Neural networks
- ✅ Text processing and embeddings
- ✅ Training neural networks

---

**Phase 3 notebooks will be available after you complete Phase 2!**

Keep learning - you're making great progress! 🌟
