# Phase 3: Mini Transformer - COMPLETE ✅

Build and train a complete Transformer architecture!

## 📚 Notebooks

### 01 - Transformer Architecture
**Topics covered:**
- Complete Transformer overview (Encoder-Decoder)
- Positional encodings (sinusoidal)
- Multi-head attention (full PyTorch implementation)
- Feed-forward networks with GELU
- Layer normalization
- Residual connections
- Stacking transformer blocks
- Complete model assembly

**What you'll build:** A full Transformer architecture from "Attention Is All You Need"!

### 02 - Building Mini Transformer
**Topics covered:**
- Preparing text data for training
- Creating (input, target) training pairs
- Causal masking for autoregressive generation
- Simplified transformer for demo
- Training loop implementation
- Text generation with sampling
- Temperature control for creativity
- Evaluating generation quality

**What you'll build:** A trained Transformer that generates coherent text!
