# ML Journey to GPT - Project Instructions

This is a progressive machine learning learning project that takes you from basics to building your own GPT-like chatbot.

## Project Structure
- Phase 1: Neural Networks Basics (Image Recognition)
- Phase 2: Text and Embeddings (NLP Fundamentals)
- Phase 3: Mini Transformer (Architecture from Scratch)
- Phase 4: Build Your GPT (Custom Language Model)

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch for deep learning
- Transformers library
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning
- Gradio for web interface

## Development Guidelines
- Each phase builds on the previous one
- All code should be well-commented for learning
- Include visualizations to understand concepts
- Progressive difficulty from basics to advanced
