# Phase 4: Build Your GPT - COMPLETE ✅

The final phase - build your own GPT and interactive chatbot!

## 📚 Notebooks

### 01 - GPT Architecture
**Topics covered:**
- GPT vs full Transformer (decoder-only)
- Causal/masked attention
- Model configuration and hyperparameters
- Multi-head attention (production PyTorch)
- Feed-forward with GELU activation
- Transformer block assembly
- Complete GPT implementation
- Model scaling (Tiny → GPT-3 sizes)
- Parameter counting and efficiency

**What you'll build:** A complete, production-ready GPT architecture!

### 02 - Training Your GPT
**Topics covered:**
- Data preparation and cleaning
- Character-level tokenization
- PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader
- Training loop with AdamW optimizer
- Loss monitoring and visualization
- Gradient clipping
- Saving/loading checkpoints
- Text generation with temperature
- Top-k and top-p sampling
- Perplexity evaluation

**What you'll build:** Your own trained GPT model that generates text!

### 03 - Chat Interface with Gradio
**Topics covered:**
- Building interactive UI with Gradio
- Chat-style interactions
- Prompt engineering techniques
- System prompts for behavior control
